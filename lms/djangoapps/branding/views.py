    Send static files required for rendering the footer

    Ordinarily, clients would load static resources like
    this from /static/ URLs.  In production, these URLs always
    include cache-busting hashes.  Since these URLs are meant
    to be included directly in the DOM, we want a URL
    that is always available (e.g. /api/v1/branding/footer.css).

    On the other hand, we *don't* want to serve these
    files directy through Django, because nginx is much
    faster at this.

    For this reason, we use `django-sendfile` as a compromise.
    In production, this will use the "X-Accel-Redirect" header
    to trigger an internal redirect to the static file.
    That way, Django can resolve the path, but nginx still
    serves the file.

    If the file can't be found, this will return a 404.

    Arguments:
        request (HttpRequest)
        name (unicode): The name of the static file to load

    This end-point provides information about the site footer,
    allowing for consistent display of the footer across other sites
    (for example, on the marketing site and blog).

    It can be used in one of two ways:
    1) The client renders the footer from a JSON description.
    2) The client includes JavaScript and CSS from this end-point,
        and the JavaScript renders the footer within the DOM.

    In case (2), we assume that the following dependencies
    are included on the page:
    a) JQuery (same version as used in edx-platform)
    b) font-awesome (same version as used in edx-platform)
